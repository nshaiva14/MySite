      		<p class="main"> I am an avid tea-drinker, gamer, mystery-fiction reader, photographer, and list-maker. I love board games, especially strategy board games like Sid Meyer's Civilization and Settlers of Catan. I am also a big fan of video games, especially adventure and role-playing games. When I was younger, I was virtually obsessed with the Nancy Drew and Agatha Christie game series, although I also enjoy life simulation games like the Sims and a variety of Nintendo games. Last year, I worked at Tiltfactor, Dartmouth's game design lab, which designs games for social change by using psychological principles to promote learning, attitude, and behavioral change. I played the violin for most of my young adult life, but have been teaching myself to play the piano and guitar from various books and youtube tutorials. I have played tennis for many years, and I would have to say Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the cream of the crop. I also love to ski, and I enjoy both the fast-paced, steep slopes of Vermont and New Hampshire, and the wide, powdery, leisurely "bowls" out west, in Colorado and Utah. I love to read murder mysteries, nonfiction psychology, and comedy (Mindy Kaling and Tina Fey are my idols). My favorite movie is <em>Inception</em>, followed by <em>Interstellar</em>, then either <em>Memento</em> or the <em>Departed</em>. I'm basically Christoper Nolan's biggest fan. I enjoy listening to indie, alternative, and edm music, although I wouldn't deny that listening to the more "mainstream" top charts isn't my number one guilty pleasure.
            My family hails from New Delhi, India, so I have spent many summers visiting family there. I also studied philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland last term, and traveled a ton around Europe. I love travel, nature, and landscape photography, so feel free to check out my flickr page (link above)! </p>
