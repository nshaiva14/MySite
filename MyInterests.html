      		<p class="main">I am a cognitive science major with an eagerness to understand and analyze the complex processes that drive our everyday thoughts, behaviors, and decisions. The systems we use to represent, register, and transform information are highly elaborate, so cognitive scientists aim to integrate research from a diverse array of disciplines: computer science, philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience to simplify, clarify, and analyze human cognitive processes. One major focus in the field pertains to artificial intelligence research. I believe that by investigating the inner-workings of machines, the computer can serve as a virtual mirror, reflecting our quintessential behaviors and tendencies.

My desire to study cognitive science is reflective of my personality in many ways. I enjoy brainstorming innovative solutions to problems. I believe that with ambition and persistence, nothing is impossible. Instead of dealing with the abstract, a cognitive scientist uses the scientific method, a computational algorithm, or other concrete formalized approach to solve problems. Likewise, I strive to bring abstract thoughts to life with meticulous effort and a clear course of action. I am a thorough planner and skilled at juggling many responsibilities.

My eagerness to understand and empathize with others has fueled my development of strong interpersonal skills. It gives me great joy to make others feel welcome and engaged. Pursuing studies in a research-intensive field has also taught me the value of communicating oneâ€™s findings in a coherent manner. In focusing my efforts on journalistic pursuits, I have learned how to persuade and convey ideas with visuals and prose. In the realm of computational communication, I am proficient in four programming languages. Additionally, I enjoy photography and working with Adobe Creative Suite applications, and hence, I can also communicate effectively through multimedia manipulation.

I believe my major studies have equipped me with an interdisciplinary skill-set that enables me to blend human-centered design with computer science expertise to solve business problems.
